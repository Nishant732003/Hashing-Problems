Title:Raj's Magical Transformation Spell

Description:
Raj, a young and aspiring wizard, has discovered an ancient scroll that grants 
him the power to transform arrays of integers. He is eager to master the spell and
 has an array of integers of length N. The spell allows him to choose any subsequence of 
 the array where all elements are the same and then replace all elements in that 
 subsequence with any integer of his choice.

Example
Consider the array 

A=[1,2,2,1,2,3]. Raj can perform the following transformations:

[1,2,2,1,2,3]→[1,5,5,1,2,3]

[1,2,2,1,2,3]→[1,19,2,1,19,19]

[1,2,2,1,2,3]→[2,2,2,1,2,3]

Each of these transformations changes the frequency of elements in the array. Your task is to determine the minimum
possible value of F(A), where F(A) is the highest frequency of any single element in the array. after performing the
operation at most once.

Thought Process to Solve:

-> Firstly we will store all the element and its frequency in map key as element and occurance as value.So that we 
can keep track of element with maxFreq.
->If we choose a subsequence of identical elements and replace them with another integer, we reduce the
 frequency of the original integer in map.
->For each unique element, consider transforming all its occurrences.
After transforming, the frequency of this element becomes zero.
We can choose any integer y for replacement, which means we can increase the frequency of any other element.
->For each unique frequency, the code simulates the effect of transforming all elements with that frequency.
